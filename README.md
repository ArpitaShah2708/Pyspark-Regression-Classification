# Regression and Classification using Pyspark

In this exercise, I train regression and classification models using Pyspark through Google Cloud platform.

Regression models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Gradient-boosted Tree Regression

Classification models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gradient-boosted Tree
3. Random Forest

The goal is to compare the performance of each model on the test data.

Next step - 
Tuning the parameters for each model to improve performance.
