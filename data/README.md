## Data Scource

Data has been sourced through the following URLs:
1. Regression Data - Abalone dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone)

2. Classification Data - Pima Indians Diabetes Database through Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

I downloaded these datasets and uploaded them to my storage bucket on Google Cloud. The data was then transferred to the virtual machine and accessed from there when running the codes.
